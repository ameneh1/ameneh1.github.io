<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 135px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px">So far, I have learned many basics of HTML. I‚Äôve learned about the general formatting, the head and the body, and what goes in which section of the code -- the body contains the material going onto the website, and the head contains the information about the details of the body material. I‚Äôve learned how to create divs and what they are, and I‚Äôve styled them in the head section. I‚Äôve learned the format of HTML coding, such as using opening and closing tags, and how to use colons and semicolons. I‚Äôve realized that I learn a lot and remember many new things by just playing around to try and fix things through trial and error by myself, and I think that helps me become less dependent on asking someone else. So far, I really enjoy coding in HTML! It is definitely tricky because there are so many different commands and the formatting has to be very specific for the code to work, but I am determined to keep practicing to become more versed in HTML and to be able to eventually navigate code much more easily and understand it more fluently!

<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 375px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;">I‚Äôve learned so much by playing around with the code on my own! I‚Äôve made a lot of progress by getting different basic commands or techniques from the class website or a quick internet search, and then have played around with my code to replicate that format and then manipulate it into what I am trying to create in my code. I think this has shown me that I‚Äôve also become more comfortable coding on my own and more easily able to navigate the code myself. I‚Äôve also noticed that I‚Äôve become faster at coding because I feel more comfortable doing so. 
In the past week, I‚Äôve learned how to position objects, style images and text more in-depth, how to style text as opposed to divs and images, how to insert links into code, and how to create hover effects in my code. 
It is so gratifying when after lots of trial and error your code starts to shape up and starts to resemble what you are envisioning. I think this is a big part of why I enjoy coding -- I am able to create virtually anything I want to through code, and when I do create that, it is through the fruits of my own labor!

<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 610px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;">The second project on my website is animation. It was a new process trying to figure out how to operate the animations and how to control it in my code. I learned that there are multiple types of animations. You can make an object move, with the command ‚Äúfly,‚Äù which I was able to use to send an image of a star moving across the screen. You do this by inputting the positioning, or the coordinates of the object at different stages of the animation, and the code takes it from there and sets the object into animation. Another type of animation I used is transforming an object from one image to another. Using ‚Äúfrom‚Äù and ‚Äúto‚Äù commands, you can set an initial image and a second image to be in your animation, and the code will display the first image fading into the other. I used URLs of each of the images in my animation to embed the images into my animation code. For this project, I just played around with it and had fun using different images and objects I liked, and it turned into a very random but fun animation!

<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 840px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;">The third project on my website is my first code using javascript! On the page, you can click anywhere and the heart gif will pop up wherever you click. I was introduced to Event Listeners, and used clentX and clientY to operate the positioning of the clicker. One challenge that I had to figure out how to fix with my code was getting the div to be centered where the mouse clicks. At first, the div would appear beside the clicker, a bit high and too far to the right, and so I thought to adjust the position of the div from its automatic position, slightly lower and slightly to the left so that whenever I clicked, the div would be centered around the mouse‚Äôs positioning. A few other things that I learned about javascript is that you always write the first word of a string in all lowercase, and all following words you capitalize. I also learned about functions, using ‚Äúdocument,‚Äù and how to format code in javascript. Although it is simple, I‚Äôm happy with how the codesketch turned out, and I‚Äôm excited to use more javascript in the future!

<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 1075px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;">The fourth project on my website is a codesketch using javascript and an Event Listener. The project is a birthday card for someone, and when you click on the text that says ‚ÄúClick here to open,‚Äù the card ‚Äúopens,‚Äù and the ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù message and gif are revealed. I did this by making it so when you click on the prompting text, the ‚Äúenvelope‚Äù div disappears, revealing the card behind it. I only knew how to make it so a div would be the object that activates the changing of another div, so I made a div transparent, and put a separate text over that transparent div, so that when you click on the text it activates the function because the transparent div behind it is being clicked. Another challenge I had to overcome was fighting out how to make the ‚Äúenvelope‚Äù div disappear on the click of the other div. Because I only knew how to change the background of the div, I made the background color transparent to simulate the effect of the div disappearing. Behind the div, I placed a solid pink div of the same size, as well as a gif of confetti to make the card more lively and fun. I had tried to put text that says ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù on the card as well, but the text would always appear in front of the envelope div, which was not ideal, so I figured out that I could put text in another div, and so I did that on the pink div that created the background of the card. I then formatted that text, and although I struggled with centering the text without moving the whole div, I was able to figure that out with a few quick google searches. This project took a lot of trial and error, but I was able to produce a simple yet effective codesketch using javascript!
