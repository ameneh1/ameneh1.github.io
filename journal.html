<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 135px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px">So far, I have learned many basics of HTML. I’ve learned about the general formatting, the head and the body, and what goes in which section of the code -- the body contains the material going onto the website, and the head contains the information about the details of the body material. I’ve learned how to create divs and what they are, and I’ve styled them in the head section. I’ve learned the format of HTML coding, such as using opening and closing tags, and how to use colons and semicolons. I’ve realized that I learn a lot and remember many new things by just playing around to try and fix things through trial and error by myself, and I think that helps me become less dependent on asking someone else. So far, I really enjoy coding in HTML! It is definitely tricky because there are so many different commands and the formatting has to be very specific for the code to work, but I am determined to keep practicing to become more versed in HTML and to be able to eventually navigate code much more easily and understand it more fluently!

<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 375px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;">I’ve learned so much by playing around with the code on my own! I’ve made a lot of progress by getting different basic commands or techniques from the class website or a quick internet search, and then have played around with my code to replicate that format and then manipulate it into what I am trying to create in my code. I think this has shown me that I’ve also become more comfortable coding on my own and more easily able to navigate the code myself. I’ve also noticed that I’ve become faster at coding because I feel more comfortable doing so. 
In the past week, I’ve learned how to position objects, style images and text more in-depth, how to style text as opposed to divs and images, how to insert links into code, and how to create hover effects in my code. 
It is so gratifying when after lots of trial and error your code starts to shape up and starts to resemble what you are envisioning. I think this is a big part of why I enjoy coding -- I am able to create virtually anything I want to through code, and when I do create that, it is through the fruits of my own labor!

<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 610px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;">The second project on my website is animation. It was a new process trying to figure out how to operate the animations and how to control it in my code. I learned that there are multiple types of animations. You can make an object move, with the command “fly,” which I was able to use to send an image of a star moving across the screen. You do this by inputting the positioning, or the coordinates of the object at different stages of the animation, and the code takes it from there and sets the object into animation. Another type of animation I used is transforming an object from one image to another. Using “from” and “to” commands, you can set an initial image and a second image to be in your animation, and the code will display the first image fading into the other. I used URLs of each of the images in my animation to embed the images into my animation code. For this project, I just played around with it and had fun using different images and objects I liked, and it turned into a very random but fun animation!
