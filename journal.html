<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 135px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px">So far, I have learned many basics of HTML. Iâ€™ve learned about the general formatting, the head and the body, and what goes in which section of the code -- the body contains the material going onto the website, and the head contains the information about the details of the body material. Iâ€™ve learned how to create divs and what they are, and Iâ€™ve styled them in the head section. Iâ€™ve learned the format of HTML coding, such as using opening and closing tags, and how to use colons and semicolons. Iâ€™ve realized that I learn a lot and remember many new things by just playing around to try and fix things through trial and error by myself, and I think that helps me become less dependent on asking someone else. So far, I really enjoy coding in HTML! It is definitely tricky because there are so many different commands and the formatting has to be very specific for the code to work, but I am determined to keep practicing to become more versed in HTML and to be able to eventually navigate code much more easily and understand it more fluently!

<p style="color:black; font-size:20px; font-family:helvetica; position: absolute; top: 375px; left: 30px; margin-right: 40px;">Iâ€™ve learned so much by playing around with the code on my own! Iâ€™ve made a lot of progress by getting different basic commands or techniques from the class website or a quick internet search, and then have played around with my code to replicate that format and then manipulate it into what I am trying to create in my code. I think this has shown me that Iâ€™ve also become more comfortable coding on my own and more easily able to navigate the code myself. Iâ€™ve also noticed that Iâ€™ve become faster at coding because I feel more comfortable doing so. 
In the past week, Iâ€™ve learned how to position objects, style images and text more in-depth, how to style text as opposed to divs and images, how to insert links into code, and how to create hover effects in my code. 
It is so gratifying when after lots of trial and error your code starts to shape up and starts to resemble what you are envisioning. I think this is a big part of why I enjoy coding -- I am able to create virtually anything I want to through code, and when I do create that, it is through the fruits of my own labor!
